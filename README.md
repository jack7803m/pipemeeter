# Pipemeeter

This project is intended to serve as a Linux alternative to Voicemeeter's audio routing GUI, using PipeWire and Tauri.

TODO once there's a real frontend

## Why?

I've been using Windows for a very long time and I realized recently that one of very few things holding me there was handling audio. Obviously Linux has tools to handle audio routing, but I've tried quite a few and they all feel geared toward advanced users or specific system setups. I don't want to have to run a script every single time I want to change where an app is routed, mute myself, or change a specific app's volume. I also don't want to have to drag little input/output nodes together for every little thing. Voicemeeter was an easy solution on Windows, and I'm striving to create something (ideally) even easier to use for Linux. 

The initial goal for this project is to have an app that can create audio groups, route audio, and manage volume for every individual channel. Part of this main goal is to have a clean GUI and some sort of CLI that can interact with the main process for scripting automation. I hope to expand to cover more features that voicemeeter has (EQ, effects, audio playback, plus I'm sure many more that I've never even used), especially if anybody actually uses this project and wants anything specific.  

## Installation / Usage

TODO once there's a functional application 

(there should be builds under Github releases though)

## Roadmap

I'm working on this project at my own pace and it's very much still in early development. I'm going to mainly be using github issues to track the main tasks, so check there for current development.

## Contributing

As of right now, I will be implementing everything myself. When the base of this app gets to a place I feel is relatively stable I will update. Feel free to open an issue, though!
